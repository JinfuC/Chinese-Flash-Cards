# Chinese-flashcards
A small personal project to practise Chinese characters.

The program is written in Python and uses Tkinter. The functionality of this program is just like flashcards in real life, except it is currently only suited for practising Chinese characters. 

The list supplied to the program must be a .txt file with the following format:
|example.txt|
|---------|
|character1 pinyin1|
|character2 pinyin2|

There's also a demo.txt file in the repository as an example.

The program will randomly choose characters until every character has run out.
